GW Coding Bootcamp Assignment: create a functioning RPG using jQuery.  Last updated: Jun 7, 2018

Pokemon RPG!  Four little pokes fighting each other. Projection functions, but not consistently.  (Old assignment.)

I had a great deal of difficulty with this assignment, and I want to revisit this at some future point in order to write it properly and have it work consistently.  I've got some ideas how I want to do that.
