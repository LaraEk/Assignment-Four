~:~:~:~

* Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power. 
* For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on).
* The enemy character only has `Counter Attack Power`. 
  * Unlike the player's `Attack Points`, `Counter Attack Power` never changes.
* The `Health Points`, `Attack Power` and `Counter Attack Power` of each character must differ.
* No characters in the game can heal or recover Health Points. 

* Your players should be able to win and lose the game no matter what character they choose. The challenge should come from picking the right enemies, not choosing the strongest player.

let's try with CA being 1/4 of HP and Att starting at 1/20

BULBASAUR

[my] Att - 5 (++; each time)
[my] Cntr Att - 25

EEVEE
[my] HP - 160
[my] Att - 8
[my] Cntr Att - 40

MAREEP

[my] Cntr Att - 50

VULPIX

This'll be useful:
var gandalf = {
  "real name": "Gandalf",
  "age (est)": 11000,
  "race": "Maia",
  "haveRetirementPlan": true,
  "aliases": [
    "Greyhame",
    "Stormcrow",
    "Mithrandir",
    "Gandalf the Grey",
    "Gandalf the White"
  ]
};

function FindGandalf ()
{
  for(var i = 0; i < gandalf.aliases.length; i++)
  {
    if(gandalf.aliases[i] == "Gandalf the Grey")
    {return i}
  }
}
